# Hangman Game with Vue & TypeScript

This is a desktop-web-game "Hangman" - which stands for word-guessing.
Rules are simple:  
  You have some amount of attempts to guess word and win game before your health reaches "0" and you will become "dead".

Game currently works only with Firefox browser for reasons I can not know.
It also suppose that you use desktop pc to play it (to have UI state correct).

Try it: (Hangman-game)[hangman-game-blush.vercel.app]
