# Hangman Game with Vue & TypeScript

## This is a desktop-web-game "Hangman" - which stands for word-guessing.
Rules are simple:  
  You have some amount of attempts to guess word and **win** game before your health reaches * *"0"* * and you will become * *"dead"* *.

Game currently works only with **Firefox** browser for reasons I can not know.
It also suppose that you use **desktop PC** to play it (to have a beautiful UI state).

Try it: **[Hangman-game](hangman-game-blush.vercel.app)**
